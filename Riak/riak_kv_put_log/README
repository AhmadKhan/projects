This is a quick & dirty proof of concept for logging the keys of updated
objects in Riak for *each* vnode. Thus, each physical node in a cluster can
have a log of each key it updates, with the same durability for these logs
as for the data. The logs can be used e.g. to construct an index of updated
keys without needing to list all keys or use secondary indexing.

Example log (format MegaSecs,Secs,MicroSecs:::Bucket,Key) -
1384,206927,81663:::__riak_client_test__,key1
